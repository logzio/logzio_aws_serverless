#  AWS Serverless Shipper - Lambda

This is an AWS Lambda function that ships logs from AWS serverless apps to Logz.io.

**Note**:
This project contains code for Python 2 and Python 3.
We recommend using Python 3 because Python 2 will reach EOL soon.
 
[Get started with Python 3](https://github.com/logzio/logzio_aws_serverless/tree/support-python3/python3)
